/*
     Service layer is the in between the controller and data layer. Provides another level of abstraction
             Note:
              This is currently not implemented because it technically isn't mandatory to insert into the db

             If we do not have a service layer, we are exposing our db
             connection to the controller class, which could potentially involve some risk
